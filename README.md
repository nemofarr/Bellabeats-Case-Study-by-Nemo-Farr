# Prepare - Data Inspection
Date Sourced from FitBit public data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit  
Data permission: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic  

Data Characteristics:  
- 18 CSV files present in the dataset.
- Collected from Fitbit users with consent to submit personal tracking data generated to the public dataset. 
- Sample size of 30 users - adequate for qualitative analysis
- Tracking metrics: Physical activity, heart rate, calories burned, weight log, and sleep monitoring.

Data Limitations:
- Not all metrics were tracked by all users, more comprehensive tracking is preferred. 
- Data was captured in 2016 and is not current. Analysis will provide general trends but current tracking data is required for accuracy.
